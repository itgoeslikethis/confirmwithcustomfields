confirmwithcustomfields
=======================
Barebones proof of concept for transferring custom field values from list to list via an email click.

There's a bunch of things that are hardcoded in this example that would need to be modified or generalised or improved

1. The form code points to a form on my campaign monitor account
2. The javascript uses the labels which belong to my form
3. THe design is clunky (ie it shows the form before it submits)

All this is achievable, but this is a *proof of concept*, it's not intended to be dropped into production.
